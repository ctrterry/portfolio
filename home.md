## Projects

### Web Application with OAuth Integration and Database Management
- Developed a full-stack web application using **Node.js, Express, SQLite, and Handlebars** for managing user-generated posts and profiles.
- Implemented **Google OAuth 2.0** authentication via Passport.js for secure user login and registration.  
- Built custom APIs for fetching and displaying data (including emojis) from third-party services using `fetch`. <br>
- **Web Design Blogging Platform:** <a href="https://github.com/ctrterry/get-and-post" target="_blank"><strong> ðŸ‘‰ Click to Access</strong></a> <br>

**Networking Systems Project** *(Python | Socket Programming | DNS | TCP/UDP | BGP Analysis)*  
- Implemented **UDP client-server (iPerf)** to measure network throughput performance.
- Developed a **TCP proxy server** with JSON-based message forwarding and IP blocking for enhanced security.
- Built a custom **DNS client** capable of constructing DNS queries, parsing responses, and measuring RTTs.
- Designed and analyzed **congestion control protocols** (Stop-and-Wait, Sliding Window, TCP Reno), providing detailed performance metrics.
- Conducted **BGP routing analysis**, parsing RouteViews data to identify network routing patterns and longest autonomous system paths. <br>
- **Networking System:** <a href="https://github.com/ctrterry/Networking-System" target="_blank"><strong> ðŸ‘‰ Click to Access</strong></a> <br>
- **Visitor Pattern & AST Analysis:** <a href="https://github.com/ctrterry/visitor-pattern" target="_blank"><strong> ðŸ‘‰ Click to Access</strong></a> <br>


### Digital Design of CPU and Cache Systems
- Developed CPU and cache architectures using logic gates and digital design techniques.  
- Applied logic-based approaches to optimize memory access and data flow within the cache.  
- Conducted simulations to test and validate performance, ensuring reliability and functionality. <br>

### Operating System Project: Distributed File System with Multi-threading and File Distribution
- Designed and implemented a **multi-threaded distributed file system** in C++ to handle concurrent file operations more efficiently.  
- Utilized threads and synchronization primitives (mutexes, condition variables) to ensure thread-safe operations and prevent race conditions in shared resources.  
- Developed HTTP/REST API handlers (GET, PUT, DELETE) for files and directories.  
- Implemented a thread pool and FIFO scheduling policy to manage concurrent requests, optimizing resource utilization.  
- Maintained data consistency and fault tolerance via transactional operations (begin, rollback, commit) on disk.<br>
- **Muli-Thread & Concurrency Control:** <a href="https://github.com/ctrterry/Multi-Thread-Concurrency-Control" target="_blank"><strong> ðŸ‘‰ Click to Access</strong></a> <br>

### Database System Project: L-Store Implementation
- **Single-Threaded, In-memory L-Store**: Built a foundational in-memory database using L-Store architecture with base/tail pages for efficient data storage; implemented SQL-like operations (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE).  
- **Durability**: Added disk persistence with transactional operations (begin, rollback, commit) to ensure data consistency and crash recovery; introduced a merge process to optimize read performance by consolidating base and tail pages.  
- **Multi-threading**: Introduced concurrent processing with a thread pool and synchronization primitives to handle simultaneous transactional (OLTP) and analytical (OLAP) queries. <br>

### Canvas System Optimization
*Collaborated with Professor Dr. Jim D. Pham*  
- Rebuilt and optimized a portion of the Canvas system in C++, enhancing its framework with new features and improved performance.  
- Conducted system analysis to identify weaknesses (lack of modularity) and designed a more modular architecture for maintainability.  
- Developed key componentsâ€”rendering engine, input handler, and object managerâ€”resulting in cleaner, more maintainable code.  
- Leveraged advanced C++ features (pointers, memory management) to boost performance.  
- Delivered a more efficient and flexible Canvas system, gaining hands-on experience in teamwork, technical problem-solving, and project management. <br>
